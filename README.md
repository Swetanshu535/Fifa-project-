Fifa project contains a dataset which is used to make dashboards 

I'm currently working on an exciting project focused on FIFA match data analysis. The dataset I'm working with includes critical details from various matches such as Date, Team, Opponent, Goals Scored, Ball Possession %, Attempts, Man of the Match, First Goal, Round, PSO (Penalty Shootout), Own Goals, and Own Goal Time. By analyzing this rich data, I’m able to generate meaningful insights that contribute to the development of a comprehensive and interactive dashboard.

Some key questions I’ve tackled in this project include:

Showing the team alongside the Man of the Match for each game, which highlights standout performances and can reveal patterns in match outcomes.
Displaying the team and the total number of rounds they participated in, giving a clear view of their journey throughout the tournament.
Summing up the opponent teams and the total number of goals they scored, providing a quick reference for their offensive performance.
Identifying the PSO (Penalty Shootout) results and the corresponding Own Goal Time, offering insights into critical moments during the matches.
Showing the opponent team name along with the goals scored, enabling detailed match-by-match analysis of performance.
Each of these insights will contribute to creating a well-rounded dashboard that provides a deeper understanding of match dynamics and key contributors to success. By leveraging tools like Excel and SQL, I’m able to filter, sort, and visualize the data in a way that uncovers hidden patterns and trends.

This project has allowed me to apply my data analysis skills to a real-world scenario, reinforcing the importance of accurate data manipulation in sports analytics. Whether it's tracking team performance across rounds, evaluating the impact of individual players, or comparing key match statistics, this dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for understanding FIFA match dynamics.
